# evestx-smart-chain
The eVESTX Smart Chain was created with the primary purpose of being an EVM compatible blockchain that can bring programmability and interoperability to the eVESTX Main Chain. Forever walking along with the existing community and advanced technology will bring great benefits to everyone by staying compatible with all Ethereum smart contract tools. To achieve this feat, the most plausible solution was to fork go-ethereum, in a way that also maintains the great respect we have for ethereum and its technology.  The eVESTX Smart Chain started its development based on the fork of go-ethereum, so you can see in the project folders many tools, binaries and also documents based on Ethereum, with the name “geth”.
